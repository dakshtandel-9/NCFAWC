                        Cold chain warehouse & reefer logistics is a specialized supply chain process that ensures
                        temperature-sensitive goods, like pharmaceuticals and food items, are handled and transported
                        at controlled temperatures to prevent spoilage and maintain product integrity.

                        and distribution — and uses advanced technology to maintain the product’s original condition.
