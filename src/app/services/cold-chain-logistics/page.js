                        Cold Chain Warehouse & Reefer Logistics is a specialized supply chain process that ensures temperature-sensitive goods, like pharmaceuticals and food items, are handled and transported at controlled temperatures to prevent spoilage of shelf life and maintain product integrity.
                        <br />
                        It involves all stages from manufacturing to delivery, including storage, transportation, and distribution.
                        <br />
                        This is the best way of using technology to provide the products’ complete shelf life, maintaining it at its original origin stage throughout its complete lifecycle — for all kinds of perishable items.
